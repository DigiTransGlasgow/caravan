# Connected Communities & Digital Futures
_Part of Unbox Labs: Caravan edition 2016_

The UnBox platform offers a space
<br/>for experiential learning that
<br/>builds on emerging contexts and
<br/>cases of multidisciplinary, creative
<br/>collaborations that are rooted in
<br/>people-centric approaches.

<br/>Incepted as an annual festival
<br/>in India in 2011, and a fellowship programme
<br/>since 2012, UnBox has prompted
<br/>new thought and partnerships at the
<br/>intersections of design, art, culture,
<br/>social transformation and enterprise.

The UnBox LABS provide a form of
<br/>‘controlled experiments’ - in harnessing
<br/>ideas within collaborative, people-
<br/>centered settings. We believe this
<br/>approach to be essential for driving
<br/>sustainable and inclusive resolutions
<br/>to the complexities that our collective
<br/>futures will throw up.

The models of collaboration that
<br/>the labs seek to fosters are new and
<br/>experimental.
