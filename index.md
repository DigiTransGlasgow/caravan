<p>
          <br/>The UnBox platform offers a space
          <br/>for experiential learning that
          <br/>builds on emerging contexts and
          <br/>cases of multidisciplinary, creative
          <br/>collaborations that are rooted in
          <br/>people-centric approaches.
<br/>
          <br/>Incepted as an annual festival
          <br/>in India in 2011, and a fellowship programme
          <br/>since 2012, UnBox has prompted
          <br/>new thought and partnerships at the
          <br/>intersections of design, art, culture,
          <br/>social transformation and enterprise.
<br/>
          <br/>The UnBox LABS provide a form of
          <br/>‘controlled experiments’ - in harnessing
          <br/>ideas within collaborative, people-
          <br/>centered settings. We believe this
          <br/>approach to be essential for driving
          <br/>sustainable and inclusive resolutions
          <br/>to the complexities that our collective
          <br/>futures will throw up.
<br/>
          <br/>The models of collaboration that
          <br/>the labs seek to fosters are new and
          <br/>experimental.
