<p>The UnBox platform offers a space for experiential learning that builds on emerging contexts and cases of multidisciplinary, creative collaborations that are rooted in people-centric approaches.
<br/>
Incepted as an annual festival in India in 2011, and a fellowship programme since 2012, UnBox has prompted new thought and partnerships at the intersections of design, art, culture, social transformation and enterprise.
<br/>
The UnBox LABS provide a form of ‘controlled experiments’ - in harnessing ideas within collaborative, people- centered settings. We believe this approach to be essential for driving sustainable and inclusive resolutions to the complexities that our collective futures will throw up.
<br/>
The models of collaboration that the labs seek to fosters are new and experimental.
